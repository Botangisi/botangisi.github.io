Botangisi is a nonprofit organization with the aim to promote and develop
digital training, focusing on accounting and international cooperation.

### The Term "Botangisi"

The word "Botangisi" means “teaching” in
[Lingala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingala), a Bantu language spoken in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The use of the term Botangisi includes both
teaching and learning, describing more of a group action of teachers and
students. This is how the Botangisi association desires to be positioned: at the
heart of a participative act of education that considers different parts, those
who deploy the teachings and those who receive them.
